# NAN Wasm app catalog

Every file here is baked into the `nan-wasm-manager` image and therefore covered
by Tinfoil attestation: what runs in the enclave is exactly what was measured at
deploy. To add an app, drop its compiled `.wasm` here and add an entry to
`catalog.json`.

> **This is the attested, baked-in catalog** — the curated apps the enclave runs
> today, referenced by id (e.g. `hello`). There is a *second*, separate catalog:
> the **on-chain community app store** (`NanAppCatalog` on Base, the **Apps** tab
> on the site) where anyone publishes `wasi:http` apps addressed by IPFS CID. That
> one is open discovery, not attested — see `contracts/README.md`. Apps from that
> store deploy by `ipfs://<cid>` (or `slug:version`): the manager fetches the CID,
> verifies the bytes hash to it (`ipfs_fetch.py`), and runs it. Baked-in apps here
> are still referenced by id and covered directly by the image measurement.

## App requirements

Apps must be **`wasi:http` components** (the format `wasmtime serve` runs). The
component exports the `wasi:http/incoming-handler` interface: it receives an HTTP
request and returns a response, like a serverless function. The manager owns the
listener and binds it to a per-tenant loopback port; the app never opens its own
socket.

**Service apps (firewall ports).** A catalog version published with a firewall
config (`http:N` / `tcp:N` / `udp:N`) runs differently: the manager launches it
with `wasmtime run` and grants **wasi:sockets** (`-Stcp -Sudp -Sinherit-network
-Sallow-ip-name-lookup`), and the app is a long-running *command* component that
binds its ports itself (Rust `std::net` on `wasm32-wasip2` maps to wasi:sockets).

**WASIp3 (component-model async).** Both modes are also launched with `-S p3`
(wasmtime 45+), so apps may target the WASIp3 API surface — native async
sockets/streams instead of wasip2's poll-based ones — as an alternative to
wasip2. Every other rule is unchanged: same `NAN_PORTS` contract, same bind
audit, same no-fs/no-env sandbox, and the p3 flag does not widen network
access (that stays gated by the socket grants above). Note guest toolchains
are still young — e.g. Rust lists a `wasm32-wasip3` target but most distros
don't ship its std yet. Operators can set `WASM_P3=0` on the wasm-manager to
drop the flag fleet-wide.

Declared ports are **logical** — the app's stable, advertised interface, like a
container's EXPOSE. Each deployment gets its own **actual** loopback bind, so two
tenants can run "the tcp:5432 app" at the same time with zero conflicts; the URL
routes by deployment id, never by raw port. The mapping is handed to the app as

```
NAN_PORTS=tcp:5432=31245,udp:9053=31246     # logical=actual — BIND THE ACTUAL
```

**The one rule for app authors: read `NAN_PORTS` and bind the actual ports.
Never hardcode.** (When the logical number is free the manager assigns it
unchanged, so hardcoded apps limp along single-instance — until the audit kills
them for binding an unassigned port when it isn't.) Enforcement: a /proc audit
sweep kills any app binding an unassigned port ≤19999; logical labels are
1-19999 (8080/8091 reserved; below 1024 — e.g. `udp:53` — always remapped, since
privileged actuals are never bound). `http:N` means "the app serves HTTP on N" and
the supervisor proxies `/x/:id` to its actual bind; `tcp:N` ports are reached
via the WebSocket bridge `/x/:id/tcp/N` — always the logical N; the supervisor
resolves it to the deployment's actual (see `portMap` on the deployment record).

**Direct public TCP (no websocat).** A declared `tcp:N` is also served at
`/x/:id/tls/N`: same bridge, but the supervisor terminates the *client's* TLS
in-enclave first (platform key + cert minted in-enclave at boot; enabled by
`TLS_BRIDGE_DOMAIN`). An untrusted public relay (`relay/README.md`) SNI-routes
`<dep-id>.tcp.<domain>:<port>` into that path, so stock clients (`irssi --tls`,
`psql sslmode=require`) connect directly while the relay only ever carries
ciphertext. Apps need nothing for this — keep speaking plain TCP on the
assigned port; TLS is platform dressing. Verifying clients can bind the
session to the attestation: `GET /v1/tls-bridge` (served over the attested
origin) publishes the platform cert's fingerprints to pin.

**Public UDP (`udp:N`).** A declared `udp:N` is bridged at `/x/:id/udp/N`
(datagrams over the WS, 1 message = 1 datagram). Because UDP has no SNI, each
deployment gets its **own IPv6** (from the box's /64; the deploy response's
`network.udp` shows `[address]:port`), and the UDP relay routes by address.
The app just binds its assigned actual UDP port as normal. Two limits worth
knowing: it's **IPv6-only** (a box has one v4), and the relay sees **cleartext**
(it's not a confidentiality boundary — encrypt at the app, e.g. DTLS, if you
need privacy). See `relay/README.md`.

Sandbox defaults (nothing to configure): a private writable `/data` (see below),
no host environment, no network beyond the served HTTP socket, memory capped per
app via `mem_mb` in the catalog. Peer isolation = separate Wasm sandbox +
separate OS process per app.

**Scratch filesystem (`/data`).** Every deployment is launched with a private,
writable `/data` preopen (wasi:filesystem via `wasmtime --dir`), so off-the-shelf
code that reads and writes files — a SQLite DB, a cache, config, logs — ports to
wasm without being rewritten. In Rust it's just `std::fs`/`std::path` under
`/data`; other languages' stdlib file I/O maps to the same wasi interface.

It is **RAM-backed and strictly ephemeral**: the enclave's whole filesystem is a
ramdisk (already inside the TEE's encrypted memory), and `/data` is torn down
when the deployment ends. There is no persistence and no shared storage — treat
it as scratch space, not a database of record. Isolation is the wasi capability
model: an app sees *only* its own `/data`; there is no preopen for anything else,
and a path escaping the tree (`/data/../../etc/...`) is refused by the runtime.

Usage is capped per app by `storage_mb` (default 256; the audit sweep kills an
app that exceeds it, since a ramdisk file tree consumes RAM that `mem_mb` doesn't
cover). Set `storage_mb: 0` to opt an app out of `/data` entirely (back to the
old no-filesystem sandbox). Operators can disable the feature fleet-wide with
`WASM_FS=0` on the wasm-manager, or relocate the backing dir with `WASM_FS_DIR`.

## catalog.json

```json
{
  "apps": [
    { "id": "hello", "name": "Hello", "file": "hello.wasm",
      "description": "…", "mem_mb": 128, "storage_mb": 64 }
  ]
}
```

- `id`     - what the frontend/user selects; what the supervisor sends as `image`.
- `file`   - the `.wasm` in this directory.
- `mem_mb` - per-instance guest memory cap, enforced on the Wasm linear memory
             via `wasmtime -W max-memory-size` (not RLIMIT_AS — wasmtime reserves
             terabytes of virtual space for bounds-checking, so an RLIMIT_AS
             small enough to bound RAM would kill the runtime). Optional;
             defaults to `WASM_APP_MEM_MB` (512).
- `storage_mb` - ceiling on the app's `/data` scratch filesystem (see above),
             enforced by the audit sweep. Optional; defaults to
             `WASM_APP_STORAGE_MB` (256). `0` disables `/data` for this app.

## Building the sample `hello.wasm`

Requires the Rust toolchain and `cargo-component`:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-wasip2
cargo install cargo-component

# in a scratch crate:
cargo component new hello --lib && cd hello
```

Set `wit/world.wit`:

```wit
package nan:hello;
world hello { export wasi:http/incoming-handler@0.2.0; }
```

`src/lib.rs`:

```rust
use wasi::http::types::{Fields, IncomingRequest, OutgoingBody, OutgoingResponse, ResponseOutparam};
wasi::http::proxy::export!(Component);
struct Component;
impl wasi::exports::http::incoming_handler::Guest for Component {
    fn handle(_req: IncomingRequest, out: ResponseOutparam) {
        let resp = OutgoingResponse::new(Fields::new());
        let body = resp.body().unwrap();
        ResponseOutparam::set(out, Ok(resp));
        let stream = body.write().unwrap();
        stream.blocking_write_and_flush(b"nan-wasm-ok\n").unwrap();
        drop(stream);
        OutgoingBody::finish(body, None).unwrap();
    }
}
```

Build and install into the catalog:

```bash
cargo component build --release --target wasm32-wasip2
cp target/wasm32-wasip2/release/hello.wasm /path/to/nan/wasm/apps/hello.wasm
```

(Exact WASI binding APIs shift between `wasi` crate versions; pin the crate
version documented for your `cargo-component`, and let the build errors guide the
handler signature. The shape above is the stable wasi:http/proxy pattern.)

## Verifying an app locally

```bash
wasmtime serve --addr 127.0.0.1:8080 apps/hello.wasm
curl 127.0.0.1:8080/    # -> nan-wasm-ok
```

If that works locally, it works in the enclave; the manager runs the identical
command per tenant on a private port.
